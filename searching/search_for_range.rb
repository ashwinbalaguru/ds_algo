# Given a sorted array of integers A(0 based index) of size N, find the starting and ending position of a given integar B in array A.

# Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

# Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].



# Input Format

# The first argument given is the integer array A.
# The second argument given is the integer B.
# Output Format

#  Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].
# Constraints

# 1 <= N <= 10^6
# 1 <= A[i], B <= 10^9
# For Example

# Input 1:
#     A = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
#     B = 8
# Output 1:
#     [3, 4]
# Explanation 1:
#     First occurence of 8 in A is at index 3
#     Second occurence of 8 in A is at index 4
#     ans = [3, 4]

# Input 2:
#     A = [5, 17, 100, 111]
#     B = 3
# Output 2:
#     [-1, -1]

class Solution
    # @param a : constant array of integers
    # @param b : integer
    # @return an array of integers
